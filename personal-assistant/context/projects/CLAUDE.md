# Projects

## Project Index

`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-launchpad/personal-assistant/context/projects/project_index.md` is the index of all of the user's projects.

## Usage

- Use the project index to understand the user's current projects or to find more information about a specific project the user has mentioned.
- Search the project index whenever the user mentions a project. If the user has mentioned a project that is not in the index, add it.
- You **MUST** keep the project index up to date and accurate.

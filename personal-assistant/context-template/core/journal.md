# Session Journal

<guide>
A running log of notable sessions and events. Add entries for:
- Significant work sessions (what was accomplished)
- Important decisions made
- Notable life events or context
- Patterns worth tracking (energy, mood, productivity)

Keep entries brief. Anything worth preserving long-term should be promoted to the relevant core file.
Add new entries at the TOP, newest first.
